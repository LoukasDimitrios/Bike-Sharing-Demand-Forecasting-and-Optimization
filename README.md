# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Forecasting-and-Optimization
Developed predictive models to forecast bike-sharing demand and optimized bike allocation strategies to enhance operational efficiency and user satisfaction in urban bike-sharing systems



# Introduction:
The bike sharing project analyzes and predicts bike demand patterns in a bike-sharing system. Using machine learning, the project aims to improve bike distribution and operational efficiency.

# Implementation

## Part 1: Data Cleaning and Exploration

* Birth Year 1969 Analysis: Examine and clean data entries related to birth year 1969.
* Data Cleaning and Visualization: Clean data, visualize key attributes, and identify any issues.
* Basic Statistics and Visualization: Calculate summary stats, visualize data, and explore feature relationships.
* Correlation Analysis: Analyze feature relationships using correlation matrix.
* Data Standardization: Standardize data for consistency and scalability.

## Part 2: Prediction Challenge

* Clustering Analysis: Use DBSCAN algorithm for clustering and select optimal parameter combinations.
* Cluster Analysis: Identify clusters with high demand and analyze spatial distribution of bike pickups and drop-offs.
* Time Aggregation: Aggregate data into hourly intervals and compute mean/median values.
* Lagged Variables: Create lagged variables to capture temporal dependencies.
* Prediction Models: Build linear regression and artificial neural network (ANN) models for predicting bike demand.
* Demand Prediction: Predict bike demand for the following day based on cumulative departures and arrivals.

## Part 3: Exploratory Challenge

* Station Grouping: Group stations by demand levels and analyze spatial distribution of demand.
* New Dataset Integration: Integrate weather or other datasets to study their impact on bike demand.
* Seasonal Analysis: Analyze seasonal variations in bike demand and their correlation with weather variables.
